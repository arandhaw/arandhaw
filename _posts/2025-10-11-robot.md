### Overview

Every summer, 2nd year Engineering Physics students are split into 16 teams that compete to win a robotics competition. For six weeks, we do nothing but robotics. My team of four was able to win the competition, and it will forever be one of the most memorable moments in my university degree.

Our year, we were challenged to pick up six idols in an obstacle course. Here is the graphic of the obstacle course for our year:



The first section of course has a line of black tape which can be followed with a reflection sensor. There is then a short section of chicken wire, following by a 30x30cm archway that the robot must fit through. After this section, the tape disappears. Two infrared becon at different frequencies are situated in this section. (The idea is that you filter out one of them and go in the direction of the other one). On each side of the central section, there are rockets. 

To get to the third section, you have to ride the zipline (a horizontal metal bar). In the third section, two circular platforms are connected by a rectangul ramp. Finally, there is a second zipline that can be rode to the end area. 

To gain points, we must collect idols  - there are 5 silver idols and 1 gold idols, plus extra points for reaching the end. Lastly, one of the idols is a "bomb" - if you pick it up, you explode. It is identified by a magnet placed inside. 

We were the only team to get a perfect score.
